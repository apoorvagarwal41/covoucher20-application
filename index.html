          <h1>A word from the founder</h1>
          <p>Hello!</p>
          <p>
            My name is Miguel Morin and I founded CoVoucher20. I studied the
            Great Depression of 1929 for my PhD in Economics. In the US during
            the 1930s, millions of people lost their businesses and their homes;
            they lived in makeshift camps called Hoovervilles.
          </p>
          <p>
            When countries started locking down, I knew that a crisis of this
            size could mean death for millions of local businesses. So I used my
            background in software development and my recent passion in
            entrepreneurship to launch CoVoucher20 in record time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before CoVoucher20, I had studied computer science at Ecole
            Polytechnique in Paris; done a PhD in Economics at Columbia
            University in New York; worked at the Faculty of Economics at the
            University of Cambridge in the UK; worked in artificial intelligence
            at The Alan Turing Institute in London; and launched Puzzli, a smart
            toy to teach children to read.
          </p>

          <h1>Similar initiatives</h1>
          <p>
            Several other initiatives have heeded the challenge and are
            promoting a similar concept. This is no time for bickering and
            businesses need all the help they can get, so we decided to promote
            them here.
          </p>
          <p>
            It looks like no similar initiatives are available near you. If you

          <h1>The challenge</h1>
          <p>
            Everyone is talking about it: local business owners face an
            existential threat. Local business owners may be unable to pay
            staff, utility bills, and even their mortgages. Owners and employees
            need those homes to stay safe from the virus.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that generosity is the answer: consumers can support
            valued business that they want use after the crisis. The finances of
            the business may take a dip but they won't completely crash.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can avoid a crash in our local communities by keeping the money
            flowing and helping businesses adapt and survive.

          <li>
            Local businesses sign up, enter their location, explain their
            business, and enter details.
          </li>
          <li>
            Businesses share a direct link to their CoVoucher20 page with their

          <li>
            Patrons sign up and buy vouchers that they would like to use after
            the pandemic.
          </li>
